# Pixel_Art_Maker_INP
## This is a Udacity HTML,CSS,and JavaScript Project for Intro to Programming Nano Degree.

In which I created a online,single-page, web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

## How to run it :

Download all 3 files of code, and then from your files run the INDEX.HTML FILE in your browser.Do not run the CSS or JavaScript files.

Alternatively you can also view my pixelmaker at : https://januniku812.github.io/Pixel_Art_Maker_INP/

**Note:When I got stuck or needed a referance I used w3schools and StackOverflow.
